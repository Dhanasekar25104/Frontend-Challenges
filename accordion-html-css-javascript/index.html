        <h1>Frequently Asked Question</h1>
        <div class="qn">
            <p>Why is the moon sometimes out during the day?</p>
            <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-plus" onclick="display('qn1')"></i>

        </div>
        <p id="qn1">The moon can be visible during the day because it orbits the Earth, and its position relative to the
            Earth and the Sun changes over time. The moon reflects sunlight, which means that when it's in the right
            position in the sky, it can be bright enough to be seen even when the Sun is up.</p>
        <div class="qn">
            <p>Why is the sky blue?</p>
            <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-plus" onclick="display('qn2')"></i>
        </div>
        <p id="qn2">The sky appears blue because of Rayleigh scattering. Shorter blue wavelengths scatter more than
            longer red wavelengths when sunlight interacts with the atmosphere. This scattered blue light is what we see
            when we look up at the sky. During sunrise and sunset, the sky can look red or orange due to the longer path
            sunlight travels through the atmosphere, scattering more blue light out of our line of sight.</p>
        <div class="qn">
            <p>Will we ever discover alliens?</p>
            <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-plus" onclick="display('qn3')"></i>
        </div>
        <p id="qn3">The discovery of extraterrestrial life remains one of science's biggest questions. While we haven't
            found definitive evidence yet, the vastness of the universe suggests that the possibility is real. Ongoing
            efforts, such as searching for microbial life on Mars, studying extreme environments on Earth, and scanning
            the cosmos for signals, aim to answer this question. Advances in technology and space exploration may one
            day provide the evidence we seek.</p>
        <div class="qn">
            <p>How much does the earth weight?</p>
            <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-plus" onclick="display('qn4')"></i>
        </div>
        <p id="qn4">The Earth weighs approximately 5.97×10245.97×10 24kilograms, or about 5.97 sextillion kilograms.
            This massive weight is determined through measurements of gravitational effects and calculations involving
            the Earth's density and volume.</p>
        <div class="qn">
            <p>How do aeroplanes stay up?</p>
            <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-plus" onclick="display('qn5')"></i>
        </div>
        <p id="qn5">
            Airplanes stay up by generating lift through their wings, which create a pressure difference between the top
            and bottom surfaces. Engines produce thrust to move the plane forward, allowing air to flow over the wings.
            Lift counteracts the weight of the plane, keeping it in the air. Effective design minimizes drag, enhancing
            stability and efficiency.</p>
